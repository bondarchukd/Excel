Here is my experience in testing to upload and then to parse xlsx files using PHP. 
Main goal was to upload xlsx file, make some calculation with data and output result to the screen.
Any external libraries and frameworks were not allowed except libraries for handling excel files.
What I did:
1. Choose PHP library for handling xlsx files
